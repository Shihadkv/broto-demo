                <p>School of Practical Studies (SPS) helps the young Indian generation who had benefited nothing from
                    our countryâ€™s poor education system by providing an intensive industry relevant training on the
                    leading software technologies.

                <h3>What we do</h3>
                <p>The SPS program is completely FREE upfront and our students pay zero tuition fee until they land a
                    job. We believe everyone should get the right opportunities to learn, hence we do not charge any
                    fees upfront.

            </div>

                <h3>How we do </h3>
                <p>SPS is not just another training institute where you go learn something and leave forever. SPS is a
                    community of high performance people who support each other and to win together. Each SPS grad will
                    always be in touch with our community and help the new buddies as a way of giving back.
